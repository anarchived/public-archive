## Description
This base was originally founded 06/05/2020 by Gestimo and Dainert. After the grief of Eiffel Base/Fort base, all members moved here.  The base had multiple phases of activity but ultimately became inactive after most members had left the server. The base held many map arts made by Dainert, as well as a large nether side, goldfarm, blaze farm, ghast farm and a small guardian farm.

## Additional Info
Most of the builds at the base are from schematics and the only original build is the storage room. Afdud discovered it in 2021 and was the first visitor to find the base. DezzDox (famous player) would attempt to dupe no less than 2 times (maybe more???) here. There was also a nether hub with tunnels leading to a blaze farm and ghast farm (probably wasn't saved in the download). The Eiffel Tower is a recreation of a build from Eiffel Base, one of DezzDox and Kokichii's previous bases. After more than 3 years the base was sent off by TunaBeef and FB on 06/28/2023.
