## Description
Oudo's download of the legendary Ghanda 2.5! Largest active base by both members and land area in the server's history. Founded by Klayyy in 2021 after Ghanda 2 was abandoned. At first, only a few members were invited but as time went on the base grew to be over 20 members including notable players such as SSJNSSJNSSJNSSJN, FB, MortalVeteran, Lord_Met, and many others. Never again has there been a base with so many active members on the server since. An almost 2Kx2K area of various builds with a few farms. The ruins are still mostly intact today and were later repurposed by new players who knew nothing about the base in 2022.

## Additional Info
3rd (and largest) base of Ghanda
